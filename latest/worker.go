// Worker provides a worker goroutine that uses the Chan type from
// this package to send and receive data. This makes it ideal for
// coordinating work between goroutines when new work always invalidates
// old work and neither goroutine can afford to block waiting on the other.
//
// Worker should always be constructed by calling NewWorker.
type Worker struct {
	in, out *Chan
	work    func(interface{}) interface{}
}

// NewWorker constructs a worker and launches a goroutine. The provided
// function will be run on each input to the Push method, and the return
// value will be available via Pull() or Raw(). Because the input and
// output are managed wtih Chans, the worker goroutine will only ever block
// waiting when there is no new input. It will never block trying to send
// output.

// Close shuts down the input channel. This will cause the worker
// goroutine to terminate once it finishes its current work (if
// any). You can tell when the worker is stopped when the channel
// returned by Raw() closes.
